# Getting Started with Marvel App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Start the application by running ### npm start this will open the application in your browser on http://localhost:3000

## Homepage

Once on the home page a random list of characters is displayed each time the page loads. You can search for a specific character by utilizing 
the search bar. The search bar is setup to perform autocomplete based on the returned list of characters from the Marvel API.

Once you have found a character you would like to learn more about simply click on the image and you will be taken to that characters page.

## Character and Creator Page

When the character page loads you will see the main character image, a description of the character if available. There will also be links 
to the character's Marvel.com page and their Wiki on Marvel.com. Scrolling down the page and you will see comics that the character has 
appeared in. Clicking on a comic image will take you to a page that displays the comic book's creators. Both pages, character and creators, has
a Home button that will return you to the homepage.
